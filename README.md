# HousePrice_Regression

A dummy project on House Price regression datas found on Kaggle. Using Python and different Feature Engineering and visualisation methods.

I'm planning to add a part using Tensorflow to create the Neural Network. I should change the model used to make the final prediction to Logistic Regression to optimize computational power maybe ?
